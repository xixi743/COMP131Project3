# COMP131Project3
Social Network - Collaborative Filtering

This was an assignment for my COMP131 class - Fundamental of Computer Science.
It uses the collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend new friends to a user in a social network.
It looks at the friends you already have and they friends that they have who are not yet your friends
and then recommmends them to you as new friends.
